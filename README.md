## Hi there 👋

# 📊 Automated WAEC Result Entry and Performance Analysis System (Excel)

---

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project is an Excel-based system designed to **automate the entry, computation, and analysis of WAEC student results**.  
It classifies student performance based on **credit attainment**, **compulsory subject combinations (Mathematics & English)**, **gender distribution**, and **subject-level outcomes**.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Manual analysis of WAEC results is:
- ⏱️ Time-consuming  
- ❌ Prone to calculation errors  
- 📉 Difficult to aggregate across gender and compulsory subjects  
Making schools struggle to generate accurate summaries for decision-making.

## 💡 Solution
An **automated Excel workbook** that uses:
- Structured data entry forms
- Validation rules
- Formula-driven logic  
to compute student results and generate **instant performance analysis**.


## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- 📘 Microsoft Excel  
- 🔽 Data Validation (Dropdown Lists)  
- 🔢 Logical Functions (`IF`, `IFS`)  
- 🔍 Lookup Functions (`VLOOKUP` / `XLOOKUP`)  
- ⚙️ Automated Calculations & Aggregation
